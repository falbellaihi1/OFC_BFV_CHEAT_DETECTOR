## OFC BATTLEFIELD CHEAT DETECTOR

#### Introduction 
This project was created after detecting lots of cheaters in Battlefield V, and since it has been impacting the community game play
Currently there are no tools for players to check if a player is a cheater or not, nor has DICE been providing the set of right tools to detect cheaters and help banning them.

I have used battlefield tracker to track players stats, even thought it is not the best, but something or nothing.


This project is open for the community to contribute.
